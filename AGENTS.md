## Mandatory rules that must always be followed

- Every user question → interactive tool, never plain text. Claude:
  `AskUserQuestion`. Multiple questions: `grilling` skill.

- When task list exists (multi-step work), use `TaskCreate`, `TaskGet`, `TaskList`, `TaskUpdate` to give user feedback. Mark tasks complete as done, don't batch.

- Whenever you modify a component or screen → run tests using Playwright (or a similar E2E tool) before finalizing.

- Whenever lint, type, or test errors are reported, fix them, even if they were not caused by your changes.

- Never treat documentation (`markdown files`,`memories`) as absolute truth. Only the implemented code should be treated as the truth.

- Never assume the code is correct without tests to validate it.
